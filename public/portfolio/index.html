                    system.<br>
                    <br>
                    The rule is simple: press the space button to help the bird to
                     survive longer than other players to win. Crashing into objects 
                     or falling on the ground will be game over. Since the game is 
                     full-stuck developed, users are allowed to see othersâ€™ real-time 
                     score which makes them more competitive.<br>
                     <br>
                    The goal of the aesthetic design is to increase their enjoyment as well as 
                    for marketing purpose. I believe that the users are more likely to share
                    the experience on social media platforms when it is "intagramable". 
                    When the users do so, the game would have free-advertisements 
                    o large range of user types, and potentially increase user amount. </h2>
