            <p class="detail">
                The rule is simple: press the space button to help the bird to
                survive longer than other players to win. Crashing into objects 
                or falling on the ground will be game over. Users are allowed to see othersâ€™ real-time 
                score which makes them more competitive.<br>
                <br>
                Utilized Adobe Color, and prototyped the game with the sample colors multiple 
                times for selecting the appropriate color theme. The color choice was inspired by 
                the trendy design for attracting the users and increasing their enjoyment. 
                Our team care much about the design in this project especially because 
                we believe that the users are more likely to share
                the experience on social media platforms when it is artistic or more like "instagramable". 
                When the users do so, it will eventually increase the user amount.<br>

                Started the project with handling the Reddit authentication system with
                a python library called praw. After that, I did data cleaning such as 
                removing emoji(e.g. symbols and pictographs), non 
                english/numeric characters, and stopwords.<br>

                Linking the program to a generating wordcloud website
                is to provide a wordcloud image. The image visualizes trending topic 
                and important words by differenciating word sizes which makes it easier 
                for the users to understand what's going on within the group chat without 
                scrolling all the way.<br>

                There has been many challenges that I overcame as a programmer, 
                and there will be many more challenges waiting for me. This journal can be 
                one of my point of references in solving issues when 
                I encounter these new challenges in the future. 
                I believe this is a way to improve my programming skill from different perspective.<br>
                <br>
                This Journey includes problem solving processes, project outcomes, 
                and my real-time thoughts in regards to coding. 
                Coding is one of favorite things, and I am purely excited to see 
                my growth in few years or even more with this project. <br>
