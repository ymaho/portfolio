            <h1>Pretty Flappy Birdy</h1>
            <h2>Not just a flappy bird game: the aesthetic designed Flappy Bird game with dynamic leaderboard and scoring 
                system.<br>
                <br>
                The rule is simple: press the space button to help the bird to
                 survive longer than other players to win. Crashing into objects 
                 or falling on the ground will be game over. Since the game is 
                 full-stuck developed, users are allowed to see othersâ€™ real-time 
                 score which makes them more competitive.<br>
                 <br>
                The aesthetic design is to increase their enjoyment as well as 
                for marketing purpose. We believe the users are more likely to share
                the experience on social media platforms when it is "intagramable". 
                When the users do so, the game would have free-advertisements 
                o large range of user types, and potentially increase user amount. </h2>

            <h1>Reddit Text Analysis</h1>
            <h2>A program that allows us to conduct text analysis<br>with visualization technique on a chat group in Reddit.<br>
                <br>
                Started the project with handling the Reddit authentication system with
                 a python library called praw. After that, I did data cleaning such as 
                 removing emoji(includes symbols and pictographs), non 
                 english/numeric characters, and stopwords.<br>
                 <br>
                 Linking the program to a generating wordcloud website
                 is to provide a wordcloud image. The image visualizes radius of the trending topic 
                 or important words by differenciate word sizes which makes it easier 
                 for the users to understand what's going on within the group chat without scrolling all the way.<br>

            <h1>My programming Journey</h1>
            <h2>A single project that I will consistently work as I continue my programmer career.<br>
                <br>
                There has been many challenges that I overcome until today, and I am 
                sure that there will be more and harder challenges in the future. I started this project 
                to remind myself that "I can do it" and "Don't give up". Obviously this project is not a programming project, 
                but I can confidently say that I as a successful programmer will find it useful.<br>
                <br>
                This Journey includes problem solving processes, project outcomes, and my real-time thoughts. 
                Although I started this project as my own use, I am considering to publish this as it might 
                provide an oppotunity for other programmers to learn from my mistakes or my progress as a programmer.
