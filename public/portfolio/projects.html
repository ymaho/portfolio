                <p>Not just a flappy bird game: the aesthetic designed Flappy Bird game with dynamic leaderboard and scoring 
                system.<br>
                <br>
                The rule is simple: press the space button to help the bird to
                 survive longer than other players to win. Crashing into objects 
                 or falling on the ground will be game over. Users are allowed to see othersâ€™ real-time 
                 score which makes them more competitive.<br>

                The goal of the aesthetic design is to increase their enjoyment as well as 
                for marketing purpose. I believe that the users are more likely to share
                the experience on social media platforms when it is "instagramable". 
                When the users do so, the game would have free-advertisements 
                to various types of users, and potentially increase user amount.<br>

                <p>A program that allows us to perform sentiment analysis in a subreddit with visualization technique.<br>

                    Started the project with handling the Reddit authentication system with
                     a python library called praw. After that, I did data cleaning such as 
                     removing emoji(includes symbols and pictographs), non 
                     english/numeric characters, and stopwords.<br>

                Linking the program to a generating wordcloud website
                is to provide a wordcloud image. The image visualizes trending topic 
                and important words by differenciating word sizes which makes it easier 
                for the users to understand what's going on within the group chat without 
                scrolling all the way.<br>

                <br>
                There has been many challenges that I overcame as a programmer. When 
                I encounter new challenges in the future, this journal would be 
                one of my point of references in solving the issue. <br>

                This Journey includes problem solving processes, project outcomes, 
                and my real-time thoughts in regards to coding. 
                Coding is one of favorite things, and I am purely excited to see 
                my growth in few years or even more with this project. <br>
