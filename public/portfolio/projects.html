            <h1>Pretty Flappy Birdy</h1>
            <h2>Developed a flappy bird game with dynamic leaderboard and scoring 
                system as one of my team projects.<br>
                <br>
                The game is simple: press the space button to help the bird to
                 survive longer than other players to win. Crashing into objects 
                 or falling on the ground will be game over. Since the game is 
                 full-stuck developed, users are allowed to see othersâ€™ real-time 
                 score which makes them more competitive.<br>
                 <br>
                The aesthetic design is to increase their enjoyment as well as 
                for marketing purpose. We believe the users are more likely to share
                the experience on social media platforms when it is "intagramable". 
                When the users do so, the game would have free-advertisements 
                o large range of user types, and potentially increase user amount. </h2>
